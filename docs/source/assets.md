### Metadata label prediction - Cell type classification

This task evaluates how well model embeddings capture information relevant to cell identity. This is achieved by a forward pass of the data through each model to retrieve embeddings, and then using the embeddings to train different classifiers, in this case we are using Logistic Regression, KNN, and RandomForest,to predict the cell type. To ensure a reliable evaluation, a 5-fold cross-validation strategy is employed. For each split, the classifier's predictions on the held-out data, along with the true cell type labels, are used to compute a range of classification metrics. The final benchmark output for each metric is the average across the 5 cross-validation folds.

### Cross-Species Batch Integration

This task evaluates the model's ability to learn representations that are consistent across different species. There is a forward pass of the data (each species is treated as an individual dataset) through the model. Once embeddings are generated for each species, they are concatenated into a single embedding matrix to enable cross-species comparison. Finally, the concatenated embeddings, along with the corresponding species labels, are used to compute evaluation metrics.Â

### Genetic Perturbation Prediction
Warning: This task is still in progress. Results are subject to further validation.

This task evaluates the performance of models fine-tuned to predict cellular responses to genetic perturbations. The process involves applying the fine-tuned model to a test dataset and comparing its predictions with observed ground-truth perturbation profiles. Predicted gene expression profiles after perturbation are generated by running a held-out dataset through the fine-tuned model. These predicted profiles are then compared to ground-truth gene expression profiles for the applied perturbations.

## Guidelines for Included Assets

As cz-benchmarks develops, robust governance policies will be developed to support direct community contribution.

At this stage, the cz-benchmarks project represents an initial prototype and policy and project governance are intended to provide transparency and support the project in its current phase. Initial guidelines are as follows:

- All content (datasets, tasks, metrics) included in cz-benchmarks currently represents a subset of recommendations from CZI staff.
- Future versions will incorporate an expanded and refined set of assets. However, not all assets are appropriate for inclusion in a benchmarking platform. Benchmark assets are chosen based on overall quality in relation to comparable reference points, current standards in the research community, and relationship to supported priority benchmark domains as outlined in the [roadmap](./roadmap.md). Formal asset contribution and asset governance policies are in development.
- **Note**: TranscriptFormer was developed by the CZI AI team using separate task implementations. The cz-benchmarks task definitions, developed by the CZI SciTech team, were not included as a part of TranscriptFormer training and evaluation.
- At this phase, the CZI SciTech team will guide initial decisions, coordinate updates, and ensure that all assets conform to policy requirements (licensing, versioning, etc.) through direct collaboration with working groups, composed of domain-specific experts from the broader scientific community and partners.Â
