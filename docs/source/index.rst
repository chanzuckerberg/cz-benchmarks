cz-benchmarks documentation
===========================

**PROJECT STATUS: UNSTABLE**

**This project is under development and not yet stable. It is being actively developed, but not supported and not ready for community contribution. Things may break without notice, and it is not likely the developers will respond to requests for user support.**

CZ Benchmarks is a package for standardized evaluation and comparison of biology-oriented machine learning models (starting with single-cell transcriptomics) across various tasks and metrics. The package provides a modular architecture for running containerized models, executing evaluation tasks, and computing performance metrics.
