CZ Benchmarks Documentation
===========================

CZ Benchmarks is a reproducible benchmarking package designed for standardized evaluation and comparison of biology-oriented machine learning models (starting with single-cell transcriptomics) across various tasks and metrics. It supports plug-and-play benchmarking of models and tasks using Docker containers, with support for custom models, datasets, and evaluation metrics.


Key Features of CZ Benchmarks:
------------------------------

- âœ… **Modular and Customizable**: Effortlessly integrate new models, datasets, tasks, and metrics to suit your research needs.
- ðŸ¤œ **Extensible for Innovation**: Build and expand custom benchmarks tailored to cutting-edge computational biology challenges.
- ðŸ“Š **Metrics-rich Evaluation**: Benchmark models across diverse tasks, including clustering, embedding, integration, perturbation prediction, and label prediction, using a wide array of metrics.
- ðŸ§¬ **Single-cell Native**: Designed to work seamlessly with AnnData and biological datasets, making it a perfect fit for single-cell transcriptomics research. Image modality coming soon.
- ðŸš€ **Scalable and Efficient**: Leverage container-based execution with GPU support for high-performance benchmarking.


Why Choose CZ Benchmarks?
-------------------------
