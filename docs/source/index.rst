CZ-Benchmarks Documentation
===========================

CZ Benchmarks is a reproducible benchmarking package designed for standardized evaluation and comparison of biology-oriented machine learning models (starting with single-cell transcriptomics) across various tasks and metrics. It supports plug-and-play benchmarking of models and tasks using Docker containers, with support for custom models, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

- âœ… Modular: Add models, tasks, and metrics easily
- ðŸ¤œ Extensible: Build custom benchmarks
- ðŸ“Š Metrics-rich: Evaluate models across clustering, integration, perturbation, and prediction
- ðŸ§¬ Single-cell native: Works seamlessly with AnnData and biological datasets
- ðŸš€ Scalable: Use container-based execution with GPU support

**Project Status: UNSTABLE**

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - This project is under development and not yet stable. It is being actively developed, but not supported and not ready for community contribution. Things may break without notice, and it is not likely the developers will respond to requests for user support. Feedback and contributions are welcome, but user support is limited for now.
