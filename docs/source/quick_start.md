# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **cz-benchmarks**! This guide will help you get started with installation, setup, and running your first benchmark in just a few steps.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- üêç **[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
- üíª **Hardware**: Intel/AMD64 architecture CPU with NVIDIA GPU, running Linux with [NVIDIA drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/driver-installation-guide/index.html).


## Installation

You can install the library using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cz-benchmarks/) (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the library is via PyPI:

```bash
pip install cz-benchmarks
```

### Option 2: Install from Source (For Development)

If you plan to contribute or debug the library, install it from source:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cz-benchmarks.git
    cd cz-benchmarks
    ```

2. Install the package:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

3. For development, install in editable mode with development dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

## List Available Datasets and Tasks (CLI)

Use the **cz-benchmarks** CLI to list supported datasets and tasks.

- **List all available datasets**:
    ```bash
    czbenchmarks list datasets
    ```

- **List all available tasks**:
    ```bash
    czbenchmarks list tasks
    ```

For a full list of options, run:
```bash
czbenchmarks list --help
```

## Running Benchmarks

The library is designed to be used programmatically within your Python workflow. Here‚Äôs how you can run a benchmark task on a model's output.

This example demonstrates how to evaluate a cell embedding that has been generated by your model, using the clustering task.

```python
import numpy as np
from czbenchmarks.datasets import load_dataset
from czbenchmarks.tasks import ClusteringTask, ClusteringTaskInput

# 1. Load a benchmark dataset
# This dataset has pre-defined labels we can use for evaluation.
dataset = load_dataset("tsv2_bladder")

# 2. Generate or load your model's cell embedding
# For this example, we'll generate a **dummy embedding**.
# In a real scenario, this would be the output of your ML Model.
n_obs = dataset.adata.n_obs
n_features = 128
my_model_embedding = np.random.rand(n_obs, n_features)

# 3. Instantiate the desired evaluation task
# We'll use the ClusteringTask to see how well the embedding
# separates known cell types.
clustering_task = ClusteringTask()

# 4. Prepare the input for the task
# The task needs the ground-truth labels from the dataset.
task_input = ClusteringTaskInput(
    obs=dataset.adata.obs,
    input_labels=dataset.labels
)

# 5. Run the task and get the results
# The task evaluates your embedding against the ground-truth labels.
results = clustering_task.run(
    cell_representation=my_model_embedding,
    task_input=task_input
)

# 6. Print the results
# The output will contain metrics like Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
# and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).
print(results)
```
