# Roadmap

## Now

- Launch the initial version of cz-benchmarks with:
  - A static set of assets for single-cell transcriptomics
  - Access to models and datasets (including processing scripts used)
  - Basic test suite
  - Steps to run these benchmarks reproducibly on a userâ€™s local machine
  - Documentation across the repo

## Next

- Partner with the community to outline a contribution process (for models, then tasks, then datasets) to cz-benchmarks.
- Enable simple usage and testing of cz-benchmarks on your own models, datasets, and tasks.

## Future

- Refine the contribution processes to enable automated submission of assets from community and partner entities, including supporting governance structures, peer-review, and validation processes for contributed assets.
- Expand supported benchmarks into the imaging domain.
- Enable hosted evaluation on held-out datasets.
