# CZ Benchmarks

CZ Benchmarks is a package for standardized evaluation and comparison of biology-oriented machine learning models (starting with single-cell transcriptomics) across various tasks and metrics. The package provides a modular architecture for loading datasets, running containerized models, executing evaluation tasks, and computing performance metrics.

## Key Features of CZ Benchmarks:

- âœ… **Modular and Customizable**: Effortlessly integrate new models, datasets, tasks, and metrics to suit your research needs.
- ðŸ¤œ **Extensible for Innovation**: Build and expand custom benchmarks tailored to cutting-edge computational biology challenges.
- ðŸ“Š **Metrics-rich Evaluation**: Benchmark models across diverse tasks, including clustering, embedding, integration, perturbation prediction, and label prediction, using a wide array of metrics.
- ðŸ§¬ **Single-cell Native**: Designed to work seamlessly with AnnData and biological datasets, making it a perfect fit for single-cell transcriptomics research. Image modality coming soon.
- ðŸš€ **Scalable and Efficient**: Leverage container-based execution with GPU support for high-performance benchmarking.


## Why Choose CZ Benchmarks?

- **Reproducibility at Its Core**: Docker-based environments ensure uniformity and reproducibility across experiments.
- **Comprehensive and Insightful**: Gain deep insights into model performance with task-specific evaluations and detailed metrics.
- **User-friendly for Scientists**: Intuitive command-line interface and a well-documented Python API make it accessible for computational biologists and data scientists alike.
